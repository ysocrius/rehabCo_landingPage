# RehabCo - Physical Therapy Clinic Website

This project is a static website for RehabCo, a physical therapy clinic. It's a front-end implementation built with HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript, based on a Figma design.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Modern UI**: Clean and modern layout.
- **Service Showcase**: Sections to display the different services offered.
- **Contact Information**: Easy access to contact details and social media links.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes some JavaScript for UI effects.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To view the website, you can either open the `index.html` file directly in your browser or run a local server for a better experience.

### Prerequisites

You don't need any specific tools to view the website. However, for running a local server, you will need either Python or Node.js installed on your system.

### Running a Local Server

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the files).
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Choose one of the following options:

    - **Using Python:**
      ```bash
      python -m http.server
      ```
      The site will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

    - **Using Node.js (with `serve`):**
      If you don't have `serve` installed globally, you can run it with `npx`.
      ```bash
      npx serve
      ```
      The site will be available at a local address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
